# Smart Speed Alerting Device
 Vehicle overspeeding has become one of the major causes of accidents. This device is intended to detect speeding vehicles and automatically alert relevant users by sounding a buzzer and sending texts with GPS coordinates to their mobile phones. If the car continues to violate the speed limit, an SMS is sent to traffic authorities.
